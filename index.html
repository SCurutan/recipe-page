                  <h2> Story </h2> 
                  <p>Right after graduating from my first degree, I decided to do what all college kids do and travel <mark>Europe</mark>. And like all 22-year-olds, I <em>didn’t have much money to my name, so I decided to take a small job overseas </em> to pay for my <b>trip of a lifetime. </b> I was able to find one with a summer camp in Italy that boarded tutors and paid for their travel to the different regions of <mark>Italy</mark>. I was one of the lucky ones set to stay near <mark>Florence</mark> and I was the luckiest one as I was boarding with the very loving and hospitable <i>Donati Family.</i> One night, the nonna I was staying with, Paola, decided to teach me how to make <b>fresh pasta.</b> Strictly in Italian, I stumbled my way through the lesson and was able to make <i>pappardelle</i> successfully. Now back in <mark>Canada</mark> ten years later, I still remember that lesson like it was yesterday and hope that you too will make it through this recipe successfully – <strong>don’t worry if a couple of stumbling blocks get in your way.</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                    <h4> STARTING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/start.jpg">
                        <li>Place flours on kitchen table and make a well in the center by using your hands to push flour away from the center while creating walls for the remainder of the ingredients. This should resemble a crater.</li>
                        <li>Crack eggs into the center of the well.</li>
                    <h4> MIXING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/mix.jpg">
                        <li>Using a fork, mix the eggs and the flour, incorporating a little at a time until everything is combined.</li>
                    <h4> KNEADING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/knead.jpg">
                        <li>Knead the mixture together for about ten minutes. If the dough is too soft and stick, add flour and if it is too hard then add cold water a tablespoon at a time.</li>
                    <h4> RESTING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/rest.jpg">
                        <li>After ten minutes, make a big ball and place a large bowl over the dough to prevent it from drying. Let it rest for 30 min at room temperature.</li>
                    <h4> ROLLING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/roll-one.jpg">
                        <li>Divide dough into 4 pieces and knead each piece until smooth.</li>
                        <img src ="img/roll-two.jpg">
                        <li>Flatten the dough and dust with a little bit of flour. Start at the lowest setting on a pasta machine by passing the dough through the rollers. Once through, fold the dough and continue this process until the pasta is to the desired thickness.</li> 
                    <h4> CUTTING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/cut.jpg">
                        <li>Pass final rolled dough through the pasta cutters to desired pasta thickness.</li>
                    <h4> COOKING & STORING </h4>
                        <img src ="img/store.jpg">
                        <li>Boil salted water to cook the pasta for 30 s or leave at room temperature to dry pasta out to use at a later date.</li>

                      <ol>
                          <li>Use eggs at <mark>room temperature</mark></li>
                          <li>You can use <mark>water</mark> instead of eggs, but the dough will be less flavourful</li>
                          <li>If you want to <mark>colour your dough</mark>, add vegetables or spices (e.g. spinach puree, herbs, beet juice) during the kneading process</li>
